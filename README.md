# N&D-CRPTR

This program is my first attempt towards simple encryption and decryption. Note that it DOESN'T use any official crypto concepts like public or private keys.

The idea is both the communicating parties will have this program. Sender will encrypt its text message using this program in a single click and send it through any channel and receiving party will decrypt it using the same app.

Basically this app just obfuscates the text into a jumbled binary characters which only this app knows how to reverse it. ;P
